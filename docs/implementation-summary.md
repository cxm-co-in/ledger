# Implementation Summary - General Ledger Application

This document summarizes all the changes implemented to address the critical issues identified in the code review.

## Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The Liquibase schema (001-initial-schema.xml) was significantly different from both the design document and JPA entities.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the database schema to align with:
- The ERD in `ledger-design.md`
- The existing JPA entities
- Proper multi-currency support

**Key Changes**:
- Added missing tables: `CURRENCY`, `FX_RATE`, `BALANCE_SNAPSHOT`
- Fixed `JOURNAL_LINE` table to use `direction` + `amount_minor` instead of separate debit/credit columns
- Fixed `POSTING` table to use `amount_minor_signed` (positive for DEBIT, negative for CREDIT)
- Added proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- Implemented tenant-aware indexing strategy

### 2. Missing Entity Classes ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Critical entity classes were missing from the codebase.

**Solution**: Created the following new entity classes:

#### Currency.java
- Primary key: `code` (3-character currency code)
- Properties: name, exponent, rounding mode, cash rounding increment
- Support for different decimal places (e.g., JPY has 0 decimals)

#### FxRate.java
- Composite key: base_code + quote_code + as_of_date
- Properties: rate, source, inserted_at
- Indexed for efficient rate lookups

#### BalanceSnapshot.java
- Pre-aggregated balances for performance
- Properties: debit_minor, credit_minor, balance_minor, entry_count
- Tenant-aware with proper relationships

### 3. Entity Relationship Issues ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Entities stored raw UUIDs instead of using proper JPA relationships.

**Solution**: Updated all entities to use proper `@ManyToOne` relationships:

#### JournalEntry.java
- Changed `ledgerId: UUID` → `ledger: Ledger`
- Updated setter method from `setLedgerId()` to `setLedger()`

#### Posting.java
- Changed `ledgerId: UUID` → `ledger: Ledger`
- Changed `entryId: UUID` → `journalEntry: JournalEntry`
- Changed `lineId: UUID` → `journalLine: JournalLine`
- Changed `accountId: UUID` → `account: Account`
- Changed `partyId: UUID` → `party: Party`

#### Account.java
- Changed `ledgerId: UUID` → `ledger: Ledger`
- Updated setter method from `setLedgerId()` to `setLedger()`

#### Ledger.java
- Changed `functionalCurrencyCode: String` → `functionalCurrency: Currency`

### 4. Missing Repository Interfaces ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Repository interfaces were missing for new entities.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive repository interfaces:

#### CurrencyRepository.java
- Basic CRUD operations
- Find by code, exists by code

#### FxRateRepository.java
- Find most recent rate for currency pair
- Find rate for specific date
- Optimized queries for rate lookups

#### BalanceSnapshotRepository.java
- Find most recent snapshots
- Find snapshots by ledger and date
- Tenant-aware queries

#### PeriodRepository.java
- Find open periods
- Find periods by status
- Find period containing specific date

### 5. Incomplete Business Logic ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: The `postJournalEntry` method was a placeholder without critical business logic.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive business logic in `JournalEntryServiceImpl.postJournalEntry()`:

#### Validation Logic
- Account existence and tenant ownership validation
- Account active status check
- Currency constraint validation (single vs. multi-currency)
- Period status validation (only OPEN periods allow posting)

#### FX Conversion Logic
- Automatic conversion to functional currency
- FX rate lookup with fallback to inverse rates
- Precision handling with BigDecimal arithmetic
- Error handling for missing rates

#### Balancing Logic
- Functional currency balance validation
- Debit/credit equality enforcement
- Comprehensive error messages for unbalanced entries

#### Posting Creation
- Immutable posting records with proper relationships
- Sequence number assignment
- Timestamp management

### 6. Missing Service Layer ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Critical services were missing for FX rates and balance management.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive service layer:

#### FxRateService.java
- Rate upsert operations
- Most recent rate lookups
- Currency conversion logic
- Inverse rate handling

#### FxRateServiceImpl.java
- Transactional rate management
- Rate validation and error handling
- Precision and rounding management

#### BalanceSnapshotService.java
- Snapshot creation and updates
- Performance-optimized balance queries
- Running balance calculations

### 7. Missing API Endpoints ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: No API endpoints for FX rate management.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive REST API:

#### FxRateController.java
- `POST /api/fx/rates` - Create/update exchange rates
- `GET /api/fx/rates` - Get most recent rates
- `GET /api/fx/rates/{baseCode}/{quoteCode}/{asOf}` - Get specific rates
- `GET /api/fx/rates/convert` - Convert amounts between currencies

### 8. Database Schema Improvements ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Schema lacked proper constraints and performance optimizations.

**Solution**: Enhanced schema with:

#### Proper Constraints
- Foreign key constraints for all relationships
- Unique constraints for business rules
- Not null constraints for required fields

#### Performance Indexes
- Tenant-aware composite indexes
- Currency pair and date indexes for FX rates
- Account and date indexes for postings
- Balance snapshot optimization indexes

#### Data Integrity
- Referential integrity through foreign keys
- Business rule enforcement through constraints
- Audit fields (created_at, updated_at) on all entities

### 9. Sample Data ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: No initial data for currencies.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive sample data:

#### Currency Data (002-sample-data.xml)
- Major world currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, CHF, CNY, INR, BRL)
- Proper decimal place configuration
- Standard rounding modes

## Technical Improvements
